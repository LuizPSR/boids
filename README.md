## Features
- GUI to allow dynamic reconfiguration of simulation parameters.
- Select a goal point for the boids by right-clicking the screen. Deselect the goal using the Esc key.

- Boids that go out of screen reappear on the opposite side.

The Bevy graphic engine, as well as the EGUI_Bevy, a independently maintained GUI system for the engine.
